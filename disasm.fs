\ meta-definining word for instruction format disassembling definitions

\ the following word defines instruction format words, which in turn define
\ anonymous words for disassembling specific instructions and
\ put them int he appropriate decode table.

: define-format ( disasm-xt table-xt -- )
  \ define an instruction format that uses disasm-xt for disassembling and 
  \ enters the defined instructions into table table-xt
  create 2, 
does> 
    \ defines an anonymous word for disassembling instruction inst,
    \ and enters it as u-th entry into table-xt
    2@ swap here name string, ( u table-xt disasm-xt c-addr ) \ remember string
    noname create 2, \ define anonymous word 
    execute lastxt swap ! \ enter execution token of defined word into table-xt
does> ( addr w -- )
    \ disassemble instruction w at addr
    2@ >r ( addr w disasm-xt R: c-addr )
    execute ( R: caddr ) \ disassemble operands
    r> count type ; \ print name


\ all of the following words have the stack effect ( u "name" )
