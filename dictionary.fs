\ this iris program stores everything in the code section, this includes the
\ dictionary
\ the data section now acts as "core"
\ the stack section is the stack section...
\ the io section is still the io section
\ having a harvard architecture is absolutely insane, to get around this we 
\ have to become creative. Having 64kb for code and dictionary is plenty
