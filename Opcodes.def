//   R is the bit pattern denoting which of the eight registers in the group
//     to push/pop onto/off the stack
//
// The group bits define which register to start with, it is shifted by three
// internally to determine the base offset
// The registers are pushed onto the stack of lowest to highest within the 
// group. If a given bit pattern does not allow a for a given register to be pushed
// then it is skipped
//
// Registers are popped off the stack from higest to lowest to compliment the 
// the behavior of push-group
